### Arguments

| __Declaration__ | __Type__ | __Default__      | __Description__ |
|:---------------:|:--------:|:----------------:|:----------------|
| `title` | String | _Required_ | Indicator title that would be seen in Indicators/Strategies widget |
| `shorttitle` | String | _Optional_ | Indicator short title that would be seen in the chart legend |
| `overlay` | Boolean | `false` | True: Indicator added as overlay; False: added on separate chart |
| `format` | String | `format.inherit` | Type of formatting indicator values on the price axis |
| `precision` | Integer | | Number of digits after the floating point for indicator values on the price axis |
| `scale` | scale_type | | Price scale that the indicator should be attached to |
| `pyramiding` | Integer | `0` | The maximum number of entries allowed in the same direction |
| `calc_on_order_fills` | Boolean | `false` | Additional one time intrabar order calculation. Strategy is recalculated once intrabar after an order is filled |
| `calc_on_every_tick` | Boolean | `false` | Additional intrabar strategy calculations. Strategy will calculate on every tick in real-time, rather than on bars' closes |
| `max_bars_back` | Integer | | Maximum number of bars available for a strategy for historical reference |
| `default_qty_type` | String | `strategy.fixed` | Parameter to determine the number of contracts/shares/lots/units to trade |
| `default_qty_value` | Integer, Float | `strategy.cash` | Number of contracts/shares/lots/units |
| `initial_capital` | Integer, Float | `100000` | The amount of funds initially available for the strategy to trade |
| `currency` | String | | Account currency for this strategy. Optional. The default is the currency that the symbol on the chart is traded on |

| `process_orders_on_close` | Boolean | `false` | When set to `true`, generates an additional attempt to execute orders after a bar closes and strategy calculations are completed. If the orders are market orders, the broker emulator executes them before the next bar's open. If the orders are conditional on price, they will only be filled if the price conditions are met |
| `close_entries_rule` | String | `FIFO` | Determines the order in which orders are closed |
| `margin_long` | Integer, Float | `100` | Margin long is the percentage of the purchase price of a security that must be covered by cash or collateral for long positions |

| `max_lines_count` | Integer | `50` | The number of last line drawings displayed |
| `max_labels_count` | Integer | `50` | The number of last label drawings displayed |
| `max_boxes_count` | Integer | `50` | The number of last box drawings displayed |

```
strategy.entry(
    id, 
    direction, 
    qty, 
    limit, 
    stop, 
    oca_name, 
    oca_type, 
    comment, 
    when, 
    alert_message

It is a command to exit from the entry with the specified ID. If there were multiple entry orders with the same ID, all of them are exited at once. If there are no open entries with the specified ID by the moment the command is triggered, the command will not come into effect. The command uses market order. Every entry is closed by a separate market order.

```
strategy.close(
    id, 
    when, 
    comment, 
    qty, 
    qty_percent, 
    alert_message
) â†’ void

## `strategy.exit()`

```

    from_entry,
